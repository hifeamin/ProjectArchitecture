# Project Architecture

This is my base layers of my projects which is base on DDD models (anomic model). I use this for my micrservices and jobs that do anything.

In my experience of working in different projects, I realised that anemic models is very useful and sutable for microservice artitechture that each service do specific and simple task. I use this three layer artitecture for each of my microservices.

## Domain-Driven Models

There is two type of implenetation of DDD that could be implemented: Anomic Model and Rich Model.

In brife Anemic Model is a Domain Model where Domain Objects contain little or no business logic. This model was first described by Martin Fowler, who considers the practice an antipattern. Rich Model is a Domain Model where each model has own bussiness and handel bussiness in own functions.

There is lots of documents that compare these two types. Also developers usualy like one of them and do programming with that. In my experience when you want to create enterprise application with complex bussiness and it should be monolotic, you should use DDD as Rich Model which it reduce the complexity of project. But if you use microservice artitecture and each microservice has littel and simple, Anemic Model is better than Rich model beacuse it has simple and easy to learn and develop.

## Project Layers

### Data Layer

Data Layer is low level layer that works with databases. I use repository pattern to implementing this layer. This layer has two Project (interfaces and implentations). The implementation project implement all interfaces that defines in base project. The key point of this layer is that there is no bussiness. also, it do simple CRUD for each repository.

### Business Layer

#### Domain

Domain Project contains all interfaces of servcies and models. There is no implemetation in this project. This project introduce all of functionality of project. At the first of each project, Domain will be defined and then each developer implement the interfaces.

#### Business

These project is the implementation of Domain layer. It might have some interfaces and services for itself (like validation services, identity service, ...) although they are using for implemeting domain services.

### User Interface (UI)

#### Bootstrapper

This part of project configure dependecy injection (DI) to use in user interfaces. Each UI might have own services (like own serializer, logger, ...). this part will be define services in DI
