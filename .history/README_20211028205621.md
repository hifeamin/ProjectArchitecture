# Project Architecture
This is my base layers of my projects which is base on DDD models (anomic model). I use this for my micrservices and jobs that do anything.

In my experience of working in different projects, I realised that anemic models is very useful and sutable for microservice artitechture that each service do specific and simple task. I use this three layer artitecture for each of my microservices.
